A luxury holiday here is ideal for intrepid adventurers, wildlife enthusiasts and history lovers. \n `
    +`Africa's oldest independent country, Ethiopia sits at the crossroads between East Africa and the Middle East. As the only African country to escape European colonisation, it offers a fascinating insight into the continent's history, while Middle Eastern influences run throughout its culture and food. \n `

Top to bottom, it incorporates bone-dry deserts, salt flats, temperate rainforests, glaciers and fjords. On a personalised luxury holiday to Chile with The Pravasi, you'll discover the magic of this breathtaking land. \n `
    +`Santiago is a great starting point for any itinerary in Chile. This cosmopolitan city boasts stylish boutique hotels and plenty of colonial charm, and if you need a respite from city life the coast is an hour away. There's also top skiing in the nearby mountains, while the famous vineyards of Rapel Valley are easily reachable. \n `
    +`North, near the border with Bolivia, lies the Atacama Desert. There's a remarkable barren beauty in its vistas that range from otherworldly salt pan expanses and dramatic volcanoes to geo hot springs and geysers. \n `
    +`Down south lies the lush landscapes of the Lake District. Here you'll find a paradise for outdoor adventurers with wonderful hiking, kayaking and fly-fishing available among its shimmering lakes, deep forests and conical volcanic basins. \n `
    +`In the far south is Patagonia, a land that has tempted explorers for centuries, and is the crowning glory of all of Chile's natural wonders; think thick swathes of green, temperate rainforests, ancient glaciers and fjords overhanging the ocean, and whales frolicking off the coast. \n `

    DESTINATION: `Brazil`,
    DESCRIPTION : `The only Portuguese speaking country in Latin America, Brazil is a vast country and it's worth exploring in bite-sized chunks rather than trying to cover all areas in one go. With your travel preferences in mind, our experienced The Pravasi experts can create a tailor-made itinerary that brings out the best of Brazil. \n `
    +`For sophisticated city slickers, Brazil does not disappoint. In this country, there is the never-ending friendly competition between 'Paulistas' (residents of Sao Paulo), and Rio de Janeiro's 'Cariocas', with each city trying to outdo the other. Sao Paulo, while often overlooked, is the country's art mecca. Rio, on the other hand, takes the prize for dramatic geographical splendour. It's pretty hard to beat that bird's eye view as you paraglide off Sugar Mountain, or look up at Christ the Redeemer and the Corcovado from a boat down below. Other cities worthy of attention include Salvador with its cobbled streets and colourful colonial houses. \n `
    +`Brazil is the ideal destination for beaches, thanks to its long stretches of coastline. Visit the world-famous sands of Ipanema and Copacabana, but also check out the shores of Florinopolis and Buzios. \n `
    +`Other essentials include boating down the Amazon and witnessing the day to day lives of the inhabitants who live along its banks. The wildlife along this stretch is fabulous; you can catch sights of pink dolphins and different types of native macaw. Visit the remote corners of the Pantanal wetlands, where you can see jaguars if you're patient enough. \n `
}, {
    DESTINATION: `Bolivia`,
    DESCRIPTION : `Despite being a world-class trekking and outdoor adventure destination, Bolivia remains South America's most exotic and enigmatic nation. It receives fewer visitors than its neighbours and remains off-the-beaten-path, however, the land of Andean peaks, dense rainforests, desert terrain and dazzling salt flats won't remain a hidden treasure for long. Book a luxury holiday to Bolivia with The Pravasi for a truly unique and memorable experience. \n `
    +`An essential stop on your Bolivian itinerary is shimmering Lake Titicaca - “Sacred Lake of the Incas” - and the world's highest navigable lake. From La Paz, you can trek the ancient Inca trails or take in the lunar landscapes of the Valley of the Moon. \n `
    +`Perhaps the highlight of any holiday in Bolivia is the dreamlike setting of the Salar de Uyuni, the world's biggest salt flat. With their salt-encrusted hexagonal patterns and alien-looking giant cacti, these expansive white plains make for one of the most surreal experiences in South America. Add a dash of colour with a trip south to Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve for its red and green lakes and flocks of pink flamingos. \n `
    +`Bolivia is also hugely rich in culture and history - from the colonial gems left by European settlers to the vibrant still-preserved traditions of the indigenous Aymara. Visit the whitewashed colonial city of Sucre, renowned for its grand ecclesiastical architecture. Three hours away is the old silver mining city of Potosi, and the sleepy, old-world Jesuit Missions of the Chiquitos with their pretty churches are also a highlight. \n `

Up north, hotspots include the stunning Iguazu Falls and the Ibera wetlands that are home to wildlife and birds. \n `
    +`No trip to Argentina is complete without a stop in the eclectic and spirited capital of Buenos Aires. As the soul of the country, the city offers a lively scene of magnificent architecture, modern museums, vibrant street-art, and the steamy strut of the Tango.

The storybook beauty of the Black Forest - 100 miles from north to south - provides the perfect setting for outdoor adventure; on the edge lie elegant turn-of-the-century spa towns like Baden Baden.

    DESTINATION: `Italy`,
    DESCRIPTION : `Italy has an embarrassment of riches. There's natural beauty in abundance: Alpine mountains capped in ice that melt into vast lakes, the craggy cliffs of the Amalfi Coast fringed by fertile Campanian countryside, in the shadow of Mt. Vesuvius. Its history and culture takes in the ancient Etruscans, the glory of Rome, the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment; you could go on and on. Its cuisine is imitated and approximated all over the world; its fashion designers - Armani, Versace, Prada - taught the world how to dress. \n `
    +`It's also somewhere that appreciates finer things; la dolce vita is the phrase often repeated about Italy, and it has luxury holidays down to an art form. From urban boutique to lakeside retreats, and Mediterranean beaches to world-famous art galleries, with The Pravasi you'll receive a highly-personalised itinerary for the perfect Italian escape. \n `

It's an incomparable city - strung across 116 islands, an interlinking lattice of canals and narrow, winding alleys - that everyone should visit at least once. Here, we'll have you staying in luxury boutique hotel in the heart of Venice Island, close to St Mark's Square and the Grand Canal. \n `
    +`South is beautiful Florence, the birthplace of the Renaissance and arguably the world's greatest city for art. Surrounding Florence, the lush countryside of Tuscany has long provided an idyllic retreat for luxury holidays in Italy. The cuisine is exquisite, and a wine tour of the Chianti vineyards is essential. \n `
    +`Farther south is Rome, Italy's masterpiece, once lauded as caput mundi (capital of the world). A living, breathing alfresco museum that harbours the treasures of an empire lost to time. \n `
    +`However, the cities only paint one side of Italy's portrait. For unrivalled Mediterranean bliss, the Amalfi Coast is synonymous with luxury holidays. Famously photogenic, old whitewashed towns cling to steep, rocky cliffs framed between sweet-smelling lemon groves and the emerald-blue sea. Exclusive seaside towns like chic Positano are luxury retreats par excellence with an idyllic lifestyle - and enviable style - designer hotels overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea, boutiques and gourmet dining.

    DESTINATION: `Spain`,
    DESCRIPTION : `The virtues of a luxury holiday in Spain have long been extolled. It has the Mediterranean climate and lifestyle, the culture and cuisine, the luxury villas and the beaches, and the beauty to rival anywhere in the world. \n `
    +`Spain is a land of many cultures offering a myriad of experiences, from Europe's premier golf courses and pintxos bar-hopping in Bilbao, to gourmet dining in Barcelona and slow-paced beach retreats.

    +`Spain has an extraordinary variety of cities. In the sundrenched south, the Andalucían cities of Seville and Granada are the classic Spain of tapas, bullfighting and flamenco.

However, its lush mountains, intriguing history, unique cuisine and plush accommodation options, can also be included in a luxury holiday itinerary, tailor-made by Lightfoot Travel. \n `
    +`Cyprus is home to an array of beaches. Some are wild, like those on the rugged Akamas Peninsula at the northwest tip of the island. Elsewhere, there are golden sands, like Golden Beach on the Karpas Peninsula in North Cyprus. Perhaps the most famous beach sits on the south coast, a shingle beach with a large rock, said to be the birthplace of Aphrodite, Goddess of Love. \n `
    +`Ideal for history buffs, Cyprus is dotted with remains of its fascinating past. The Paphos Archaeological Park houses the monumental Tombs of the Kings, large underground tombs, and Roman houses with impressive mosaics. Inland, the verdant Troodos Mountains are home to Byzantine churches with superb frescoes. \n `
    +`Cypriot cuisine mirrors its unique blend of cultures, including Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern dishes. From halloumi to seafood to mouth-watering tapas, you certainly won't go hungry here.

Thanks to an abundance of accommodation and spas, yacht-filled harbours and UNESCO-listed towns, Croatia promises a luxury holiday of a lifetime. \n `
    +`Balanced between the Balkans and central Europe, Croatia's strategic location has resulted in a rich cultural legacy that spans Roman, medieval and Venetian eras. The cobbled streets and baroque architecture of Zagreb make it one of the great central European capitals, while the medieval walled town of Dubrovnik is arguably Europe's most beautiful. \n `
    +`In the heart of the Dalmatian Coast, the old walls of Split house the Diocletian's Palace, one of the most impressive Roman monuments in the world, alongside swish bars and restaurants.

    +`Arguably, it's Croatia's islands that grab the headlines. While many of them are covered with luxuriant vegetation, there's plenty of urbane glamour with deluxe yachts moored near plush hotels and glamorous cocktail bars. We particularly love Hvar, with its lavender fields, vineyards and vibrant reputation. \n `
    +`Active types will love the range of watersports, but will be rewarded by a trip into the mainland. Hiking and biking trails line spectacular national parks, like Plitvice Lakes, along with opportunities to go rafting or rock climbing. \n `
